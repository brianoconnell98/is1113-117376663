	    <p>
	       My family and I travelled to Spain numerous times since I was born. We usually fly into Barcelona and hire a car and go from there. 
	       We usually hire a mobile home and stay for 10-14 nights. It has an amazing culture with amazing golf courses. It is home to the many
	       famous golfers which include John Ram current World Number 2, Sergio Garcia the latest Masters Tournament Champion and of course the 
	       inspirational Seve Ballesteros.

	    <div class="section" id="section2">Want to visit: Australia</div>
	    
	    <p>
	        Australia is a place where I hope to visit in the next few years. My sister just moved out there working as a financial advisor for 
	        a construction company. It is my dream to go out there next Christmas and soak in the sun and enjoy Christmas in a different kind of 
	        style on Bondi Beach. I also want to visit the Golf Coast Golf Club where he had his first big win was at the age of 13 in a 2000 
	        Australian Masters junior event.
