                My family and I travelled to Spain numerous times since I was born. We usually fly into Barcelona and hire a car and go from there.	
                It has an amazing culture with amazing golf courses. It is home to the many famous golfers which include John Ram current World 
                Number 2, Sergio Garcia the latest Masters Tournament Champion and of course the inspirational Seve Ballesteros.

        	    <p>
        	    Australia is a place where I hope to visit in the next few years. My sister just moved out there working as a financial advisor for	
        	    a construction company. It is my dream to go out there next Christmas and soak in the sun and enjoy Christmas in a different kind of
        	    style on Bondi Beach.

        	    <br/>
        	    
        	    <p>
        	    America has the balance of Famous cities and historicial sights spread across the massive country. I would love to live there when I
        	    am older because of the many famous golf courses which include Pebble Beach Links and Augusta National. America is an idealistic
        	    place to live and one day I hope to live there.
